# 29F160 to UV ERPOM Adapter

Order at your own risk. Untested. 

This board is used to recreate the UV EPROMs 27C160 and 27C322 with brand new 29F160 EEPROMs. Include 1x 29F160 and bridge JP1 with solder to emulate a 27C160, or use 2x 29F160 and populate U4 for a 27C322.

The databus is controlled by JP2, for 8 bit mode or 16 bit mode. This means you can have a 27C322 act in 8 bit mode - something the original chip did not support.
