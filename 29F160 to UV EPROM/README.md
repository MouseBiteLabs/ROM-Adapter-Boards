# 29F160 to UV ERPOM Adapter

Order at your own risk. Untested. 

This board is used to recreate the UV EPROMs 27C160 and 27C322 with brand new 29F160 EEPROMs. Include 1x 29F160 and bridge JP1 with solder to emulate a 27C160, or use 2x 29F160 and populate U4 for a 27C322.

The databus is controlled by JP2, for 8 bit mode or 16 bit mode. This means you can have a 27C322 act in 8 bit mode - something the original chip did not support.

Version 1.2 added /WE pads via JP3. The right-side pad is connected to the /WE pins of the two ROM chips, the left-side pad is connected to VCC. You can wire the /WE pad to an external point to attempt programming the 29F160 on the adapter board. Otherwise, short JP3 with a solder pad.
