# 29F160 to UV ERPOM Adapter

Order at your own risk. Untested. 

**Design is intended for personal use only, not for modifying existing cartridges for commercial sale.** I really would rather you *not* use these adapter boards to repurpose old carts into rarer games or ROM hacks in order to sell them commercially. Use a brand new cart circuit board instead! I have plenty to choose from :)
